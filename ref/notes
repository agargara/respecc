Really cool prototype idea!

Would work well for any min-max addicts as its core mechanic is basically that already.

The only thing I see such a game absolutely needing is automation. As it is it gets repetitive really quick repeating the same actions after respec. Also if you can find any way to make each decision/node more "animatable"/alive that would make this even more killer.

Definitely a good idea here, keep working on it!

Was thinking about the idea more: it might work better as a column on one side of the screen with a line of plots. Different fruits could have different rates of growth, i.e. one fruit every 3 nodes unlocked or something. Upgrades shortening the steps, runs in directions that require more or less of certain mixes of fruits, synergistic upgrades and junk.

Really unique idea. I'm interested to see where you take it. One feature that would really make life easier would be to click on a node further away, and the game travel and allocate the nodes in between (if enough resources are available, of course). As it is there's a lot of clicking because each node takes 2 clicks.
