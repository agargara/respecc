Took a second to figure out what I was doing, but it's fantastic! Got as far as the 300 cost overground node and don't know how to get further without cheating. Seems intentional or maybe I'm missing something.

Assuming it's just WIP and worms/caterpillars and additional characters are forthcoming. My feelings off of this were like a puzzle game where each run was planned around alternately: gathering respec bonuses, optimizing resource gain, and unlocking new nodes. Thinking about idle elements and the general theme: another tab could be your home garden or something. Where the main tab is focused around exploration, narrative, and planning, the garden could be an upgradable resource pool with its own effects and unique abilities acquired via the main node screen. "Chestnut trees hold twice as many chestnuts before full," "Unpicked oranges in the garden also provide discount." An entire upgrade path surrounding worms and compost as materials only gained by sacrificing into the garden screen.

This is a lot :p A promising seed of an idea here, really stoked.
